		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>
			MakeOpenSource's goal is to create a community of programmers and developers 
			(of any skill level!) who can collaborate and contribute to 
			one another's projects.
		</p>

	<div class="row mb-3">
		<h2>Your Ideas</h2>
		<p>
			If you have an idea for a project, MakeOpenSource is the 
            perfect place to share it and find like-minded people to work 
            on it with you. To submit an idea, visit the <a href="{% url 'idealab:index' %}">IdeaLab</a> page;
			to contribute to an existing project, visit the <a href="{% url 'projects:index' %}">Projects</a> page.
		</p>

	<div class="row mb-3">
		<h2>Open Source for All</h2>
		<p>
			Just as you don't have to be a computer scientist 
			to have an interest in programming, you don't have 
			to be a computer science major to be a part of 
			MakeOpenSource. If you want to strengthen your 
			programming knowledge, MakeOpenSource's events 
			are a great opportunity to do so.
