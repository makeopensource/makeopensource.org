        üê¨ Hey @everyone, I wanted to post a few updates!

1. quick reminder that we posted our when2meet form for the Spring semester here (please fill it out if you get the chance!): https://www.when2meet.com/?14071698-3HKPG

2. I&#39;m going to cancel Tuesday&#39;s meeting. We don&#39;t really have any new updates for the club aside from the good progress we&#39;ve made on our projects. Our priority is to continue that progress and prepare to transition to Spring semester!

3. This is going to be the last official week of meetings and work sessions over the winter break. *That being said, if you&#39;d like to have the space/time set aside to work on projects, I&#39;d be happy to have some informally hosted work sessions next week (feel free to ping me about that)*

Thanks for reading :)

        üêô Hi @everyone!
We&#39;re planning out Spring semester *early*, so we&#39;d like to poll people&#39;s availability next semester

Here&#39;s a when2meet form we set up, https://www.when2meet.com/?14071698-3HKPG
We&#39;ll leave this open for a week or two and use the results to finalize events for the Spring

As I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all aware, Thanksgiving weekend is this week. Please use the time to relax and take a break, you all deserve it! MakeOpenSource will not be hosting any events or meetings until next Monday :)

**General Body Meeting**
The Tuesday we come back, we&#39;re planning to have our final General Body Meeting! We hope to recap our semester and look back on the progress we&#39;ve made on our projects. For those of you who are interested in contributing in the winter, we&#39;ll talk about how we&#39;re going to keep running as a club during the break. And finally, we&#39;ll mention our plans moving forward. 

I hope to see you all there!

I would also like to take this time to ask that if you feel comfortable setting your nickname to your preferred name, we encourage you to do so, putting names to faces is much easier this way, but this NOT mandatory.

As always, if any of you have feedback for us, don‚Äôt hesitate to let us know!

        Hello @everyone! You may have noticed some changes to the discord server, and well, there are!
We have had a lot of internal discussion of how the club should be run, and how we should communicate this to all of you.
Being an open source development club, we have gone back and forth about how planning should be done, how internal disputes should be handled, and we have come to the conclusion that: there is no reason not to include all of you in those discussions!
The changes that we have implemented so far are as follows:

CALENDAR AND ONEDRIVE!
We have internally had a OneDrive for resources, and a calendar for planning, now that is accessible to you all in &lt;#816372402228297779&gt; !
(if it&#39;s on the calendar, you may attend!)

NEW &lt;#816372402228297779&gt; CHANNEL!
The rules still live here, as well as all of the resources that may be helpful!

NEW &lt;#906195427936833547&gt; CHANNEL!
This channel is designed for planning almost anything club related; whether that be meetings, new project ideas, budget related things, you name it.

NEW &lt;#904723093451337829&gt; CHANNEL!
To keep the flow of ideas and motivation going, we wanted to keep everyone up to date with what each project is doing, and so whenever you make an issue, fork a repo, make a pull request, everyone can see the work that you&#39;re doing, and hopefully be motivated to help and contribute!

NEW &lt;#887066535556943922&gt; CHANNEL!
This channel is designed for any out of scope club related development, like the website, or otherwise.

Our goal is to be involved with what you all are doing, and have you all involved with what we are doing, so please do let us know if there are ways we can further this initiative! We are always open to feedback!
        <br>

I look forward to seeing all your contributions.

It&#39;s exciting to be making the first big announcement! We had no idea the club was going to take off the way that it did, and so we stepped back for a few days and brainstormed pretty hard about how to move forward in a way that would help keep everyone involved. Anyway, here are our plans for the next few weeks, and how you can contribute:

**Git Workshop**
We know a lot of new members may not have the most experience with git or working on open source projects, and we wanted to have a workshop to kickstart project contributions. We&#39;re planning a git workshop at **7PM on Wednesday, September 8th**. The event should be held in **Knox 109**, but if we lose the room the workshop will be moved online.

**Classic Text-Based RPG** and **Two-Factor Authentication App**
Shortly after this announcement, several channels are going to go up in a new `development` category. We will post scheduling information for the planning meetings in the channel for each project. Stay tuned for more info!

**Website Development**
As many of you have probably found, our website is only _mostly_ working perfectly. We&#39;re looking for a handful (2-4) of developers with experience with web development, specifically django, who can help us get the finishing touches set up. If you&#39;re interested, please send a direct message on discord to &lt;@!554036879444541440&gt;.

I hope to see all of you at the git workshop and project planning meetings soon!
